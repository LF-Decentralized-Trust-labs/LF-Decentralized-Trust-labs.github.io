# Lab Name
_Fresh Air ._

# Short Description
_Space-time stamp server & positional stamp server._

# Scope of Lab
_Abstract: Blockchain is a timestamp server at its core. 

Fresh Air project goes beyond it: The first time-space stamp server, & the first positional stamp server. Because we live immerse in a world with time-space. 

Fresh Air brings space with unlimited possibilities to the Blockchains.

Until now, none of the current blockchains is ready for becoming a time space stamp server, nor a positional stamp server. Then we design Fresh Air.


Intro: 

The Programmers-Programmed paradox: 

Since the invention of computing started a “programmers-programmed paradox”: When the programmers mind became programmed, and they dont realize of that, and is hard to realize, or change it. 

It started when the first programmers were trying to optimize “space”in computing, because it was expensive programming computing prior perfored cards, they tried to save space. But Programmers started to create non natural programming languages, lacking the “space” in their syntax and programming languages (creating variables something.name), and next languages, which are not natural in the world we live and way we talk or write. But also this lack of “space” was then adopted by programmers, in a kind of blind faith: in the way the programmers think, and the programs are being created by them, and the way data is used,  lacking the “space”. 

The programmers-programmed Paradox and Blockchain: 

Blockchain is a timestamp server, (only one dimension at its core: time), and is being adopted worldwide. Thousand of programs -dapps, ledgers, etc- are now being created around of it, thousands programmers programming, thousands of tokens and currencies, and dozens of blockchains were created. And the economy is starting to move around of Blockchain. But all of them have something in common: they lack of “space” in the core.

...But We live in a world based on Time and Space.


Where blockchains have never gone before:  

Timespace stamp server & positional stamp server.


Fresh Air solves a lot of things. 

Think, for example, in your Birthday´s date and place: It does not exist other people in the world that were born in the same time and place than you. You are unique and identifiable across 7.6 billion people. 

Space gives more secure transactions. 

Indeed it becomes. 4X10^40 times safer than any other blockchain (time-stamp server).

Safer exchanges, currencies, wallets, transactions, mining: 

This year the largest Asian exchange lost half Billion USD when virtual currencies were stolen. And this is a common problem happening each time more often to exchanges, currencies, wallets. Most of exchanges get out of business after an event happens. None of the current blockchains (timestamp only) solutions  can ever solve it. 

But space can help it easily. Fresh Air provides safer money: People is interested in keeping their money safe.

Safer communications, safer encyptions, safer messages, safer content, safer assets. 

Space makes safer realtime messaging systems, messages, communications.

Safer compliant with any General Data Protection Regulation or Government Regulation. 

Space makes easy to comply with external or local regulations 

Safer computing programming, safer passwords, safer transactions. 

Space makes useless hash crack databases, guessing programs or even  massive attacks. 

Space makes safer passwords, and safer content. It also breaks the programmers-programmed paradox: since decades programmers have done security in a way based on time only.
 
As programmers and programs are immerse only on time, lacking space, then here, the time is an advantage for the intruder: Currently, there are crack hash databases with billions of hashes that read the hash & display the value. And lot of information like passwords, currencies,etc are vulnerable against programs guessing passwords running over the time,  programs running in one or multiple computers, and commercial quantum computers can calculate multiple combinations at the same time.

Technology moves to a georeferenced world. (mobile phones already have gps, 5G Iridium Satellite Time and Location (STL),etc).

Space makes safe computing.

Questions we are solving: 

How to make more secure coins, exchanges, wallets? 
How to make it more secure for smart contracts in daily operations, like working with IoT devices?             

50 years ago, in a TV program they said “Space, the last frontier”

in Blockchain, we are entering in the “Space” frontier.
             

Our proposal:                 Fresh Air 


What if we Create the first blockchain that is  time-space stamp server? 


Then the exchanges, currencies, transactions and wallets where people store their money will be secure. 


Option 1)With two dimensions: time and space.

It is the first time-space stamp server. 


Because we live in a world with time-space. Things happens at a specific time-space. The hash, etc, changes with time-space. crack hash databases, and try-error attacks are useless.

Safe deposit box in a specific time-space. Safe deposit boxes that opens only at certain time and place+user keypassword. For example safety boxes preset: If one tries to open the box in non authorized time-place it will not open.


Option 2) With three dimensions: time, place, and position. 

It is the first positionstamp server. (kind of Quantum timestamp server) 


Every safe box has also position(like a rotation in space) the rotation (like a vector) could add trillions or quadrillions extra possibilities to the timespace server (to get near 4x10 raised to the power 36 times safer).
The hash, etc, changes with time-space-position. 

Then crack hash databases,  try-error attacks, massive attacks are useless, and quantum atttacks are hard. (time-space-position are simulating quantum states, by changing time-space-position each instant, with 4x10^40 possible combinations for an specific period of time, makes hard for quantum computers to get the data at that specific instant).

The safe deposit boxes open only at certain time, place and position+and user keypassword. It becomes non-reversable. Every safe box is unique time-place-position. Even if another object is in the time, place, it will have different position and user keypassword.

If one tries to open the box in non authorized time-place-position-keypasssord it will not open. Safe boxes. Then coins, tokens, exchanges, wallets, microservices, move safely in it.

Smart contracts can receive payments, or do daily operations with IoT devices across the space, in a Fresh Air area.

A blockchain made of safe boxes in that space, for example.


Impact on Scalability: 

Unlimited scalability, across data. Also can reach all market share. Other of the advantages of the Fresh air model, is that when adding the space, information can be retieved, recreated when needed, even in parallel universes, with gains in speed and powerful data. 

Increase the safety of blockchain solutions but also increase functionallity, providing safe services, like secure time-space messagins systems, safe transactions, and safer money,  in all the chain: creation, exchange, transactions, transportation, storage.

It can be used to store-import all virtual currencies of the world. All the other currencies added -temporary and/or permanent- to the Fresh Air, because people and exchanges are interested in keeping their money & wallets safe.

Also, for example, practical use: retail and manufacturers could track their products while customers purchase their products across all retail worldwide.

With Fresh Air, adding “space” to the core of Blockchain, we answered this 2 questions: How to make more secure coins, exchanges, wallets? and, How to make it more secure for smart contracts in daily operations, like working with IoT devices?

Fresh Air provides: 

- Space. 
- Safest coins, exchanges, wallets. 
- No more stolen or lost wallets, exchanges, currencies. 
- Safest transactions, contracts, tokens, assets. 
- New levels of encryption 
- Safer data, 4x10 raised to the power 36. 
- Value added for Blockchain and apps 
- Aggregated value over other currencies and blockchains. 
- Safe transactions with IoT devices. (updated IoT devices-Blockchains) 
- Global Economy. 
- Faster Data processing, reconstruction. 
- Distributed transactions with unlimited scalability across parallel universes.                                         
- It can be used to store/import/transact all the virtual currencies of the world on Fresh Air.

1.12 The First Distributed data across parallel universes                  

Any help is appreciated in any collaborative way. We are starting to create it, want want to make a pilot test, creating those Blockchains and currencies. Building the first time-space stamp server on the world, and also the first positionstamp server. 
And we are wondering if it could be of your interest to participate in it.

We would like to sumit a pull request at Hyperledger.
