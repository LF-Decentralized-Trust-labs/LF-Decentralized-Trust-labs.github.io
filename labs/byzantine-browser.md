# Lab Name
_Byzantine-Browser_

# Short Description
_Byzantine-Browser is an open source analytics tool that gives developers and operators of Hyperledger blockchain networks real-time visibility into transactions and blocks as they are added to a HLF network._

Blockchain Browser is a React/Node.js web application with which a persistent database is not required. The Blockchain Browser "browses" the block store directly using the Fabric Node.js SDK.._

# Scope of Lab
_Updating a Hyperledger Fabric network configuration and adding/updating organizations requires a configuration block to be defined, signed and then executed as an update config transaction. Doing this manually with CLI tools can be complex and cumbersome.

Byantine-config provides an executable GUI application that greatly simplifies updating and adding Organizations. Users can connect to a HLF network, current configuration will be displayed, which can then be edited or new organziatons added. Also, crypto material for new organizations will be generated.  A correctly formated update transaction protocol buffer file, will be produce that can then be executed as an update transaction in order to update the network._
