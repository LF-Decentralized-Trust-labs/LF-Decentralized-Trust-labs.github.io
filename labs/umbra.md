# Short Description
This lab is to explore running Hyperledger distributed ledgers under the
[Shadow simulator](https://github.com/shadow/shadow). It began as a research
internship during the summer of 2018 and seeks to provide a tool for doing
research on consensus algorithms, smart contracts, scaling and other blockchain
related research topics.

# Scope of Lab
The scope is to make modifications to Shadow as well as to construct Shadow
plugins for Hyperledger distributed ledgers so that they can run under
simulation in a lab environment.
