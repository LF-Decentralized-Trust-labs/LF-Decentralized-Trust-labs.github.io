# Lab Name
5G-Advanced / 6G Decentralized Trust Lab

# Short Description
A research and development lab focused on decentralized trust, identity, and authorization mechanisms for 5G-Advanced and future 6G telecom networks using blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.

# Scope of Lab
The 5G-Advanced / 6G Decentralized Trust Lab explores how decentralized technologies—particularly permissioned and public blockchains—can be applied to enhance trust, security, and interoperability in modern and next-generation telecom networks.

The lab focuses on decentralized identity, authorization, and trust management for telecom service-based architectures, including 5G Core (3GPP Release 18+ / 5G-Advanced) and forward-looking 6G concepts. A key objective is to reduce central points of trust in telecom control planes by leveraging distributed ledgers to provide immutability, auditability, and shared governance for critical security artifacts.

Future work will explore cross-operator trust, decentralized identity, zero-trust security models, and interoperability challenges relevant to large-scale 5G-Advanced and 6G deployments.
