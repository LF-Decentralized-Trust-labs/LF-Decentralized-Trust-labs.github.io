# Lab Name
Sawtooth Healthcare.

# Short Description

Sawtooth Healthcare is a blockchain application built on Hyperledger Sawtooth, allowing clinics to keep history regarding patients health and claims on the blockchain.

# Scope of Lab

The scope of the lab is to develop a proof of concept (POC) for a blockchain-based solution that covers most common use case in healthcare. 

Also, this repo can be used for practical needs with Sawtooth blockchain since it covers/will cover most of components required to build dApp.

In addition I plan to add some load tests and provide comparative matrix and summary report on how various aspects/tuning may vary on performance/throughput.
