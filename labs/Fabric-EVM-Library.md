# Lab Name
Fabric-EVM-Library

# Short Description

Fabric-EVM-Library is a complete virtual Blockchain node and Smart Contract execution engine providing support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Fabric-EVM-Library is a distributed product that executes EVM supported Smart Contracts and application code. Fabric-EVM-Library runs Ethereum Virtual Machine and Web Assembly (WASM) Smart Contracts. The Fabric-EVM-Library will bring the option of the EVM to the Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth developer and user communities.

# Scope of Lab
This lab's scope is to provide the Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth communities with an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Smart Contract and application solution. The EVM is quite popular for developing Blockchain/ Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) applications. In addition, the EVM is a market-leading Smart Contract engine that not only runs on the Ethereum network but also runs on many other well-known Blockchain/DLT networks. As a market leader, the EVM has the advantage of its own community supporting numerous modern development tools and standards to develop applications for the most current Blockchain/DLT use cases. This lab intends to allow the Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth communities to use the EVM to develop Smart Contracts and distributed applications (DApps) on the Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth products. The Fabric-EVM-Library will deliver all the EVM benefits to the Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth communities.
