# Lab Name
_Byzantine-Config_

# Short Description
_GUI based executable application that allows Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) configuration blocks to be viewed and updated transactions created for channel configuration, adding new organizations, and generating crypto material._

# Scope of Lab
_Updating a Hyperledger Fabric network configuration and adding/updating organizations requires a configuration block to be defined, signed and then executed as an update config transaction. Doing this manually with CLI tools can be complex and cumbersome.

Byantine-config provides an executable GUI application that greatly simplifies updating and adding Organizations. Users can connect to a HLF network, current configuration will be displayed, which can then be edited or new organziatons added. Also, crypto material for new organizations will be generated.  A correctly formated update transaction protocol buffer file, will be produce that can then be executed as an update transaction in order to update the network._
