# Lab Name
_Byzantine-Config_

# Short Description
_GUI based executable application that allows Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) configuration blocks to be viewed and updated transactions created for channel configuration, adding new organizations, and generating crypto material._

# Scope of Lab
_Updating a Hyperledger Fabric network configuration and adding/updating organizations requires a configuration block to be defined, signed and then executed as an update config transaction. Doing this manually with CLI tools can be complex and cumbersome._

Byantine-config provides an executable GUI application that greatly simplifies updating and adding Organizations. When invoked an initial connect screen will appear. You will need a network peer node address, Userid, access to your private key, and Fabric Binaries_
