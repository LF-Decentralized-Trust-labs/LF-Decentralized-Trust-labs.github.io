# Lab Name
Identity Bot

# Short Description
IdentityBot is a decentralized governance layer for the internet, empowering users to control their data and digital rights through self-hosted 'Identity Agents.' These agents consolidate fragmented identities, manage consent, and standardize data exchange, providing a universal framework and set of tools to end 'Identity Chaos.'

# Scope of Lab
The internet's underlying OSI model lacks a user-centric governance layer, leading to "Identity Chaos" — the fragmentation, misuse, and uncontrolled proliferation of private data. This chaos contributes to a $10.5T cybercrime industry, a $489B data brokering market operating without user consent, and a significant loss of digital rights and agency for individuals. Existing protocols address symptoms in isolation, often increasing complexity rather than solving the root problem.

The IdentityBot Lab proposes to create the internet's missing eighth layer: a universal governance layer. This framework empowers users through actionable, self-hosted 'Identity Agents' that act as digital representatives — managing data, enforcing consent, and protecting rights across all OSI layers. The lab's mission aligns directly with LF Decentralized Trust by creating a comprehensive, unified system to restore trust, rather than fragmented solutions.

The initial scope of the lab will focus on developing the core protocol and a reference implementation to support two high-impact use cases:

   1. Unify AI Conversations: Enable individuals to own and control their data when interacting with AI systems.
   2. Eliminate Spam: Consolidate and enforce a user’s communication preferences across all channels (email, SMS, calls).

To achieve this, the lab will focus on delivering foundational capabilities, which include but are not limited to:

   - Self-Hosted Identity Agent Setup
   - AI Chatbot
   - Digital Wallet
   - End-to-End Encryption
   - Privacy Controls and Consent Management
   - User-Governed Data Vault and Key Vault
   - Identity Management and Authentication (including SSO)
   - Credential Issuance and Verification
   - A Framework "Bill of Digital Rights".

The ultimate goal is to foster an open-source, interoperable standard that reduces systemic complexity while enabling every internet user (consumer and business) to be in control of their digital identities and data. Beyond standardization, the goal is for internet users to retain actionable control of their entire digital presence through their identity agent.

This project has been tested and validated over the past 7 years. We decided to turn it into an open-source project in July 2025. The open-source code is being extracted from the proprietary code generated during the private development phase. 

This lab’s goal is to attract adequate sponsors and contributors over the next few months, then be converted to an official project. Many existing Linux Foundation and LFDT projects are candidates for integration with Identity Agents.
