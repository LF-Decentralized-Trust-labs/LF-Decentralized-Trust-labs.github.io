# Lab Name

SParts Project

# Short Description

The Software Parts (SParts) project delivers a Sawtooth-based Software Parts Ledger that add accountabiity to tracking the open source components used in the construction of a software part whether it be a single library, application, container or an entire operating system runtime. 

# Scope of Lab

This project allows any individual, organization, foundation or supply chain to easily create a distributed ledger to track the open source components used to construct of a collection of software solutions. The initial focus was to track the open source components from which today's manufactured products and devices are constructed. A number of important benefits are obtained by knowing which open source components are used such as: 1) ensuring manufactures are able to identify and secure the distribution rights (licenses) for all open source components; 2) understanding the impact of open source security vulnerabilities; 3) enable identification of cryptography technologies (e.g., FIPS 140-2 certification, export licensing); and 4) enable accurate reporting on all open source parts as a requirement to obtaining functional safety certification for safety critical products (e.g., medical devices, aircraft, autonomous vehicles, elevators, â€¦)

# Pre-existing repository

There is an existing public repository available at https://github.com/Wind-River/sparts. We would like to create a new repo in the 
Hyperledger labs space and selectively copy components from the pre-existing repo.
