title: GitMesh Lab Proposal
---

# Lab Name
GitMesh

# Short Description
GitMesh is an intelligent Git collaboration network that uses AI to guide contributors toward mergeable contributions while helping enterprises safely adopt and fund quality open source projects.

# Scope of Lab
GitMesh will develop and maintain open source tools to automate issue triage, match contributors to appropriate tasks, and provide real-time project activity insights for open source Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). The goal is to lower onboarding barriers for new contributors, reduce maintainer workload with smart automation, and improve transparency and collaboration in open source communities. The lab aligns with LF Decentralized Trust's mission to drive innovation, transparency, and global participation through open source software collaboration and trust infrastructure.
