# Scope of Lab

This project aims to automate the deployment process of an Hyperledger Fabric network. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions and the examples released can easily deploy an Hyperledger Fabric network in a standalone machine environment, including orderer, peer chaincode and so on.

However, If you want to build up the Hyperledger Fabric network in the distributing development environments, it is not an easy task and you have to deploy the modules in each of the machine manually, which includes lots of configurations and commands and is inconvenient. Our project is a tool to help you to install the hyperledger fabric in the distributing development environments easily and conveniently.

The deployment tool provides basic mechanisms for deployment, repairment, and scaling of applications. Firstly, once you have completed the configuration of the orderer and peer，which includes the information of the role,the domain and IP address， the tool can deploy the orderer and the peer according to the configuration you have written yourself. Secondly, when the hyperledger fabric network is running， the tool can scale your hyperledger fabric network up and down with a simple command.
