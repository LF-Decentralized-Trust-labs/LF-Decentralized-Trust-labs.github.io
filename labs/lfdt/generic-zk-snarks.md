# Lab Name
Generic zk-SNARKs

# Short Description
This is an effort led by the Privacy & Scaling Explorations (Ethereum Foundation) zkID team to standardise generic zk-SNARKs.

# Scope of Lab
We hope to standardise the high-level components of a generic zk-SNARK, namely: arithmetisation, polynomial interactive oracle proof, Fiat-Shamir transform, and polynomial commitment scheme. The specification will also include information about the secure composition of these components, in particular with regard to their soundness and zero-knowledge guarantees. We will stop short of enshrining a normative proof system, but rather illustrate the usefulness of our standard by applying it to a few popular existing proof systems.

All standards contributed to this Lab will be subject to the [Community Specification License](https://spdx.org/licenses/Community-Spec-1.0.html); and all accompanying reference implementations will be licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
