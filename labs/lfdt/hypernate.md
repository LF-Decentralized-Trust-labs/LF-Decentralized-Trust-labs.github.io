# Lab Name
Hypernate

# Short Description
A robust data mapper framework for JVM-based Hyperledger Fabric chaincode.

# Scope of Lab
If Fabric allows you to keep your familiar programming language, then Hypernate will allow you to *keep your familiar programming style.*

No more low-level boilerplate code for key-value storage operations and other housekeeping tasks!
Take advantage of Hypernateâ€™s _high abstraction level, aspect-oriented approaches_ and _extensibility_ to keep your critical business logic as clean as possible!

**Summary of current features:**
1. Object-oriented CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations with explicit semantics
2. Declarative and flexible configuration of your entity keys
3. An extensible chain of middleware processors handling non-business stuff (caching, logging, tracing, etc.)

**A few additional features under development:**
- Partial and range queries based on non-key attributes
- Range query support for composite keys
- Overall friendlier query support
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Support for data schemas
