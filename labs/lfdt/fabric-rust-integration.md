# Lab Name
[Hyperledger Fabric Rust Integration](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/fabric-sdk-rust)

# Short Description
Integration of the rust language in the hyperledger fabric ecosystem

# Scope of Lab
This lab focuses on supporting chaincode written in Rust and providing a library for basic API access to Hyperledger Fabric peers. To support the basic API access, bindings for [fabric-protos](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos) will need to be implemented.
The whole implementation of the Rust integration will be oriented on the implementation of the Java libraries.
