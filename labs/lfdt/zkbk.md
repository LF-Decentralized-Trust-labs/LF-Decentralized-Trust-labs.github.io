# Lab Name

[zkbk](https://github.com/lf-decentralized-trust-labs/zkbk)

# Short Description

zkbk is a library for building first-person credentials, based on zero-knowledge proof systems. The library allows developers to create: 1) signing service for issuers to issue personhood credentials, 2) users to make attestations about other users; 3) users to produce showing proofs to varifiers.

# Scope of Lab
This open-source cryptography library implements the technical foundations of the First Person Project's decentralized trust architecture in conformance with emerging standards from the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT), Trust Over IP (ToIP), the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and W3C. Its scope covers cryptographic primitives and protocols for decentralized identifiers (DIDs), self-certifying identifiers (SCIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), pairwise private channels (DIDComm/DWN), and privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs, with explicit support for the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP). By providing rigorously specified, modular, and interoperable components, the library is intended as a reference implementation and developer toolkit for constructing agent wallets, verifiable personhood credentials, and decentralized trust graphs. In doing so, it aims to advance the realization of a globally scalable, privacy-preserving trust layer for the Internet.
