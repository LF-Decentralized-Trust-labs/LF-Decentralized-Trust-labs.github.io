# Lab Name
Hyperledger Caliper

# Short Description
This is a proposal to move Hyperledger Caliper into LFDT Labs. The task is mainly administrative since Caliper already has a separate, self-contained LFDT GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-caliper).

# Scope of Lab
Caliper is a blockchain performance benchmark framework, which allows users to test different blockchain solutions with predefined use cases, and get a set of performance test results.

# Initial Committers

# Sponsor
- https://github.com/davidkel | Dave Kelsey | Current Caliper maintainer
- https://github.com/aklenik | Attila Klenik | Current Caliper maintainer

# Pre-existing repository
Everything in the existing [hyperledger-caliper org](https://github.com/hyperledger-caliper), hopefully it can remain there.
