# Lab Name
verii

# Short Description
Verii is an enterprise-grade software stack for creating a "pay-to-verify" Verifiable Credentials ecosystem. 
 
 When issued, credentials are anchored to 
 - a distributed ledger utilized for decentralized encrypted verification key distribution and revocation registry
 - a trust registry which runs governance rules of the ecosystem and is compatible with global consumer data protection regulations.

An individual has full control over how data is shared with Verifiers

When credentials are shared, the verifier
- can be required to show a proof of payment to retrieve the verification keys from the distributed ledger
- can receive proof that the credential received came from a trusted issuer following ecosystem rules of governance
- can verify the credential is shared by the intended recipient
- can check a revocation (or suspension) status

# Scope of Lab
Verii was developed by the Velocity Network Foundation, a non-profit foundation established in 2019 with the mission of transforming the way career and education data is exchanged. 

 Verii provides to ecosystems a decentralized software stack usable by their issuers, verfiers and individuals. Individuals have verifiable tamper-proof digital
 credentials that are trusted universally by Verifiers within the ecossystem. Verii is built from the seminal specifications of W3C Decentalized Identifers v1.0 and
 W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1. 
 
 The stack plugs into a separate and optional incentivization and pay-to-verify model.

 ## Trust Registry API & Portal
 A NodeJS Fastify API with a ReactJS Portal, the Trust Registry serves as the backbone of the ecosystem maintaining a
 verified directory of organizations, services & credential types in the ecosystem. It
 provides the APIs to create trust framework underpinned by ecosystem administration processes for participants to confidently
 interact and exchange credentials.

 ### Blockchain Contracts

 Solidity smart contracts for:

 -   Secure storage and distributition of encrypted keys and credential metadata
     issued within the network
 -   Pay-to-verify support using a NFT-like mechanism
 -   Access control

 ### Credential Agent

 A NodeJS Fastify API used by Issuers and Relying Parties to securely issue, revoke, replace & verify credentials on the network. Additional capabilities include:

 -   Multi-tenant
 -   Enterprise-grade APIs & Data Feeds
 -   Flexible authentication mechanisms
 -   Pay-to-Verify support
 -   Integrated credential verification flows

 ### Wallet SDKs

 The Wallet SDKs exist for NodeJS, native iOS, native Android, and ReactNative. Targeted at end-user devices, they implement the VelocityCore exchange protocols for network interoperability and integrate into the trust registry for data interoperability, counterparty trust, and data trust.
