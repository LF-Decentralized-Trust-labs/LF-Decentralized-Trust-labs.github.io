# Lab Name
ChainLaunch

# Short Description
ChainLaunch is a platform that simplifies blockchain network deployment and management, focusing on Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Besu.

# Scope of Lab
ChainLaunch functions as a **supernode** platform that offers:

- **Easy Node Deployment**: Deploy Hyperledger Fabric and Besu nodes through an intuitive interface
- **Supernode Connectivity**: Connect with other supernodes to form larger, decentralized networks
- **Governance Management**: Manage network policies, permissions, and consensus mechanisms
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy Fabric components (peers, orderers, and CAs) without Kubernetes

The platform provides:

1. **Comprehensive Node Management**
   - Hyperledger Fabric node deployment and administration
   - Hyperledger Besu node configuration and monitoring

2. **Network Management**
   - Creation and management of blockchain networks
   - Connect with pre-existing networks

3. **Security and Operations**
   - Automated backup and recovery systems
   - Secure key management and rotation
   
4. **Administration Tools**
   - Monitoring and alerts
   - Resource optimization utilities

ChainLaunch automates Hyperledger Fabric node deployment and network creation. It reduces complexity in setting up Fabric networks, letting organizations focus on applications instead of infrastructure.

The platform handles:
- Creating Fabric nodes
- Joining nodes to networks
- Managing governance
- Monitoring performance
