# Lab Name
CBWEB3

# Short Description
CBWeb3 aims to enable a regional test network for tokenized security markets to enable cross-region interoperability among Central Banks, financial institutions and people in several countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region. The prototype innovation consists of designing and deploying a complete functional architecture to model and experiment with settlement. A Testnet is a testing environment that allows central banks to experiment with issues such as token emissions, cross-border payments, real-time settlement, among others. The value of this Testnet lies in enabling central banks to conduct these experiments through a unique interoperable protocol, ensuring compatibility for experimentation among beneficiary countries.

# Scope of Lab
The lab's scope encompasses the creation of interoperable tokenized security tokens system that transcend geographical boundaries, thereby promoting trade, investment, and economic cooperation between countries in the regions. Central Banks, at the forefront of monetary policies, can benefit from shared expertise to enhance the security, efficiency, and adoption of tokenized security tokens, ultimately fostering a stronger and more interconnected global financial landscape. 
By leveraging LACChain's blockchain infrastructure, the region can establish a common ground for exploring innovative solutions and exchange knowledge.
