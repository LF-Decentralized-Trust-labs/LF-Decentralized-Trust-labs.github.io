# Lab Name
fabric-chaincode-builder

# Short Description
fabric-chaincode-builder is a Hyperledger Fabric tool that provides a standard environment for building chaincode (smart contracts). It defines how chaincode is packaged and built across different programming languages, ensuring compatibility with the Fabric peer runtime.
This is kubernetes environments and works with fabric-operator and fabric-operations-console.


# Scope of Lab
The fabric-chaincode-builder project standardizes the way chaincode is built and packaged for Hyperledger Fabric. It supports multiple languages and ensures consistent, secure, and reproducible builds. This aligns with LF Decentralized Trustâ€™s mission by enabling more reliable and interoperable decentralized applications.
