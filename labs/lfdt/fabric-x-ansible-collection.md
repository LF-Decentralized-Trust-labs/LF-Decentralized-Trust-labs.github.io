# Lab Name
[Fabric-X Ansible Collection](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/fabric-x-ansible-collection)

# Short Description
An Ansible collection to create and manage Hyperledger Fabric-X networks.

# Scope of Lab
This lab contains ansible collections to manage Hyperledger Fabric-X networks comprised of following components:
1. [Fabric-X-Orderer](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-x-orderer)
2. [Fabric-X-Committer](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-x-committer)
3. [Fabric-X-Endorser](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-x-endorser)

The lab also contains handy make files to create all necessary configuration files using new [Fabric-X-CLI](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-x-common) and then start/stop the network. Lab will evolve together with the components' codebase and might serve as foundation for future Fabric-X integration in Bevel or Kubernetes.
