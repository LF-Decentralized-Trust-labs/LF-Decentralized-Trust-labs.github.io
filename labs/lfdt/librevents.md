# Lab Name
Librevents

# Short Description
A multi-chain tool for capturing and processing events from DLT networks. This project is based on Eventeum.

# Scope of Lab
Capturing and processing events emitted by a DLT network—including smart contract events, new blocks, and new transactions—is essential for decentralized applications. Librevents builds upon the design and features of Eventeum to create a user-friendly and resilient event listener that supports a wide range of DLT protocols. Its goal is to simplify event handling by reducing the effort required to develop, deploy, and maintain application logic for capturing, processing, and broadcasting DLT events—all while meeting the security and performance demands of enterprise-grade systems.

Key Features:

* **Configurable Event Filters**. Supports filtering by smart contract events content, transaction fields (e.g., from, to) and more.
* **Resilient Event Extraction**. Designed to handle high volumes of operations while remaining tolerant to issues such as node connection failures.
* **Configurable Broadcast Recipients**. Events can be broadcast to databases, queues, in-memory objects when embedded in another application, among other options. New recipients can be easily added.
* **Flexible Deployment**. Can be deployed as a standalone microservice with a REST API for event filter configuration or embedded within another backend component, exposing Java interfaces for seamless integration.
* **Multi-DLT Support**. Compatible with multiple DLT protocols, including Ethereum clients, Hedera mirror nodes, and more.
