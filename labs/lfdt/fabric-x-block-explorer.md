# Lab Name
[Fabric-X Block Explorer](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/fabric-x-block-explorer)

# Short Description
The Fabric-X Block Explorer ingests, processes, and stores real-time blockchain data to enable easy visibility and analysis of network activity.

# Scope of Lab
The Fabric-X Block Explorer is a component within the Fabric‑X ecosystem that offers visibility into blockchain activity on the network. Its core functionality is to maintain a secure, reliable bridge to the Fabric‑X committer sidecar, from which it continuously ingests freshly committed block data. Once the raw block payload is received, the microservice validates, parses, and transforms the information into well‑structured, storage‑ready representations. 

The service persists in both block‑level and transaction‑level metadata into one or more backing data stores—relational (SQL). By indexing and enriching the blockchain data, the Block Explorer enables rapid retrieval and sophisticated analysis of on‑chain events.
