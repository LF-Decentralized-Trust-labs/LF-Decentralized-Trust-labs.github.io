# Lab Name
[Hyperledger Bevel](https://github.com/hyperledger-bevel/bevel)

# Short Description
An automation framework and helm charts for rapidly and consistently deploying production-ready Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) platforms.

# Scope of Lab
Hyperledger Bevel is an automation framework for rapidly and consistently deploying production-ready DLT platforms to cloud infrastructure. Hyperledger Bevel is an accelerator/tool that helps developers rapidly set up and deploy secure, scalable and production-ready DLT network(s) that also allows new organizations to be easily on-boarded on the network. Bevel facilitates a safe and secure way of deploying and operating different DLT platforms.

It includes:

- Helm charts to deploy different DLT nodes and to generate the related crypto/identities.
- Helm charts for various operational features like adding new nodes, and deploying smart contracts.
- Helm charts to deploy Hyperledger Cacti connectors for Fabric, Quorum and Besu networks.
- Ansible playbooks and modular role definitions to automate the deployment of Helm charts.
- Ansible playbooks and roles to automate deployment of Hyperledger fabric using bevel-operator-fabric (Kubernetes operator for managing Hyperledger Fabric networks).
- Integrated CD using GitOps so that once the network is set up, all changes can be done via git PRs/merges.
- Configuration for Ambassador Edge Stack, HAProxy (for Hyperledger Fabric) and Istio Ingress (for Substrate) to act as Ingress Controller.
- Hyperledger Bevel currently supports R3 Corda OS and Enterprise, Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Indy, Hyperledger Besu, Quorum and Substrate. Other DLT platforms can easily be added.
