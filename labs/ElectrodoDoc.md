# Lab Name
ElectdoroDoc

# Short Description
Electrodo - software service for climate-related assets and risk management to increase enterprise market value. Electrodo solves the problem of data/context integrity, data/context reliability, and trust for carbon-related assets lifecycle, climate-related risk management, and ESG reporting by using a standardized framework based on TCFD Recommendations and data verification on the blockchain.
# Scope of Lab
During the Prototype Challenge, we developed a prototype ElectrodoDoc (Fig. 1) that implements the basic functionality for the climate-related disclosure service based on Hyperledger Fabric, FIWARE context broker (Orion), and IPFS protocol. Our solution demonstrates ESG data/context management and self-verification principles in terms of climate-related disclosures' lifecycle: data/context collection and processing, data/context verification, and publication of sustainability report in line with TCFD Recommendations framework.
