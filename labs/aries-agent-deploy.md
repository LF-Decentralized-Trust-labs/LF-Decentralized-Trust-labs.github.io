# Lab Name
Aries Agent Deployment Lab

# Short Description
This lab focuses on deploying Hyperledger Aries agents using Kubernetes. The project includes Kubernetes charts and Helm packages for easy and scalable deployment of Aries agents in a cloud environment, specifically designed for AWS using Amazon EKS. It can be adjusted for use with other cloud providers as well. Also included is an agent controller. 

# Scope of Lab
The scope of this lab is to provide tools and processes for deploying Hyperledger Aries agents in a cloud environment using Kubernetes. This aligns with Hyperledger's mission of supporting robust, efficient, and scalable blockchain technologies. The lab will contribute to the development of blockchain infrastructure and applications that are cloud-native and easy to scale.
Furthermore, an agent controller, executed through the aca-py framework is included for facilitating requests between the agents.
