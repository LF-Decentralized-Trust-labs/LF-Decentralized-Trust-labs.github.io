# Lab Name
Graavity
# Short Description
Creating a high-throughput DLT for transaction processing and storing on-chain data with Byzantine Fault Tolerance.

# Scope of Lab
The prominent challenge is the inadequate throughput of existing blockchains, which manifests as low transaction per second (TPS). This inadequacy has a detrimental impact on scalability and customization, two critical requests from the perspective of end-users. Graavity is a unique implementation of Proof of Reputation based Consensus with eventual Finality that will provides enterprise users with industry-best  blockchain that achieves a speed of 1,900,000 TPS (as per last auto-scale perf-test), surpassing all existing platforms by a significant margin. This unparalleled performance will allow governments, institutions, and private enterprises to create solutions that are tailorable as well as scalable. This solution currently is not EVM-Compatiable, but the next step in roadmap is to achieve EVM-Compatibility. The next goals also include creating a inter-operability between blockchain, and supporting dynamic encryption categories and algorithms (PHE/FHE) in the VM, to significantly boost data security, and create TEEs for trusted and verifiable execution.
