# Lab Name
VS Code Plugin for Chaincode Developers


# Short Description
A VS code extension and toolbox to debugging a chaincode. The extension once installed can be used by developers of chaincode to run and debug from their IDE, to understand how their chaincode behaves.

# Scope of Lab
Hyperledger Fabric chaincode developers often have to repeat the same steps to set up their environment and deploy code for debugging. This process can be tedious and time-consuming. If the IDE had a built-in debugging interface, it could automate these tasks, making the developer's job easier and faster.
