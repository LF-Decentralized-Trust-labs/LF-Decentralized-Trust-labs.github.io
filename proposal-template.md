# Lab Name
Overture Platform

# Short Description
Overture is a No-Code Development Platform (NCDP) that has been under research and development for 2 years. Overture allows users to create programs, including  Ethereum smart contracts and Fabric chaincode using a drag-and-drop visual  languages.  Contracts can be deployed directly from the platform to Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric or any EVM based blockchain. Before a contract is deployed it undergoes a rigorous formal verification process using state of the art formal methodologies . Our technology uses several never before seen inventions that allow us to add never before seen capability to blockchain including the ability make the cost of running a process on blockchain independent of the  complexity of the process and the ability to use advanced for Our roadmap includes using Reinforcement Learning and providing integration with Apache Camel and Spring integration to achieve our vision of allowing companies to transparently add blockchain capabilities-Trustlessness and Transparency - to business processes with minimum blockchain knowledge or skills requirements.  Our roadmap also includes performance tuning our application an deploying to kubernetes cloud.

# Scope of Lab
Overture is a No-Code Application Development platform that lets you build smart contracts and other applications using a drag and drop interface (see video). Once built smart contracts can be  deployed from our platform to  Hyperledger, Ethereum or any blockchain that supports the EVM. Overture can be used to (1) integrate blockchain with enterprise back office systems using  industry best practices including integration design patterns and tested connectors; (2)  supports a multi-view architecture that encourages collaboration between business and IT by allowing each user, business, power user, and engineer to select a visual language that fits their need for a balance of capability and abstraction.; (3) de-risks blockchain projects by reducing the number of moving parts and providing realtime in-platform pre-deployment formal verification. (4) Supports the use of blockchain in mission critical applications by using powerful formal verification and emulation techniques (5) supports mapping complex business processes into blockchain including Ethereum and EVM based blockchains,
