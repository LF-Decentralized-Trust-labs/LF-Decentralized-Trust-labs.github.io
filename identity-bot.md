# Lab Name
Identity Bot

# Short Description
IdentityBot is a decentralized governance layer for the internet, empowering users to control their data and digital rights through self-hosted 'Identity Agents.' These agents consolidate fragmented identities, manage consent, and standardize data exchange, providing a universal framework to end 'Identity Chaos.'

# Scope of Lab
The internet's underlying OSI model lacks a user-centric governance layer, leading to "Identity Chaos" — the fragmentation, misuse, and uncontrolled proliferation of private data. This chaos contributes to a $10.5T cybercrime industry, a $489B data brokering market operating without user consent, and a significant loss of digital rights and agency for individuals. Existing protocols address symptoms in isolation, often increasing complexity rather than solving the root problem.

The IdentityBot Lab proposes to create the internet's missing eighth layer: a universal governance layer. This framework empowers users through actionable, self-hosted 'Identity Agents' that act as digital representatives — managing data, enforcing consent, and protecting rights across all OSI layers. The lab's mission aligns directly with LF Decentralized Trust by creating a comprehensive, unified system to restore trust, rather than fragmented solutions.

The initial scope of the lab will focus on developing the core protocol and a reference implementation to support two high-impact use cases:

   1. Unify AI Conversations: Enable individuals to own and control their data when interacting with AI systems.
   2. Eliminate Spam: Consolidate and enforce a user’s communication preferences across all channels (email, SMS, calls).

To achieve this, the lab will focus on delivering foundational universal capabilities, which include but are not limited to:

   - End-to-End Encryption
   - Privacy Controls and Consent Management
   - A user-governed Data Vault and Key Vault
   - Identity Management and Authentication (including SSO)
   - Credential Issuance and Verification
   - A framework "Bill of Digital Rights".

The ultimate goal is to foster an open-source, interoperable standard that reduces complexity and delivers true digital agency to every internet user.
