# Hyperledger Labs
Hyperledger Labs provides  a space (i.e., GitHub repos) where work can easily be started without the creation of a project. Please refer to the [Hyperledger Labs wiki page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs) for additional information.

## Process to propose a new lab

Fork this respository.

Fill out the [Proposal Template](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/proposal-template.md) and save it into the labs subdirectory under the name of your lab, such as mynewlab.md. It is expected that your lab repository will have the same name so keep that in mind.

Submit a Pull Request.

The labs stewards will then review your proposal.
