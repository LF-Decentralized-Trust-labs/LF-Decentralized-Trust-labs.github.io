# Lab Name
_NZDT-Tech-Arch._



# Short Description
Utilizing LFDT platforms and tools, produce a technical architecture for the software development of a Digital Twin for supply chains to track and model greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions for the eventual reduction to net-zero GHG emissions.

# Scope of Lab
To meet the ever more stringent GHG emission regulations imposed upon global supply chains, produce a technical architecture for the software development of Digital Twin(s) composed of LFDT blockchain technologies. Supply chain operations requirements, along with the solution architecture, will guide the production of the technical architecture. The Digital Twin is to identically represent physical supply chain with the ability to track the supply chainâ€™s GHG emissions in real time. As important, if not more so, the Digital Twin will also serve as an important tool to model changes to the supply chain to provide options for reducing GHG emissions or to ultimately achieve a net-zero footprint. With no standard procedure within global industry on the construction of a digital twin, LFDT open source software is to be promoted as the premier solution for the tracking and modeling of supply chain GHG emissions using a Digital Twin highlighting its real-time capabilities. Clear communication of the technical architecture and digital twin concepts is essential. Additionally, all LFDT components necessary for building a supply chain digital twin should be defined, along with a demonstration of the LFDT Standards Working Group data ontology to ensure consistency and effectiveness.                     Expected Outcome and Deliverables - 1) A revised reference architecture serving as the high level basis of the technical architecture. 2) A detailed technical architecture describing the key components, technical stack, security and compliance, scalability, and performance of the application-system. 3) Architecture diagrams and specific workflow designs (e.g., GHG emission data validation flow, tokenization process). 4) Technical architecture documents that include a high level user guide.
